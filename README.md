## Securing Your IT Infrastructure
Lessons from Construction Site Security

## Overview
In this GitHub lab, we will explore the similarities between IT infrastructure and construction sites to gain a better understanding of IT infrastructure security. We will compare the foundational elements, access control, security measures, maintenance and inspections, multi-factor authentication, disaster recovery plans, and education and training in construction site security with IT infrastructure security. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of essential security best practices that can help secure your IT infrastructure.

- [ ] ***Foundation:*** Just like a building's foundation, the IT infrastructure's foundational elements, such as servers and network components, need to be securely designed, installed, and configured.

- [ ] ***Access Control:*** Construction sites limit access to authorized personnel, and IT infrastructure should also have access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data and systems.

- [ ] ***Security Cameras:*** Security cameras are used at construction sites to monitor and identify potential security breaches, and IT infrastructure should also have security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.

- [ ] ***Maintenance and Inspections:*** Regular maintenance and inspections are conducted at construction sites to ensure safety, and IT infrastructure should also undergo regular maintenance and audits to identify and address any vulnerabilities.

- [ ] ***Multi-Factor Authentication:*** Just like construction sites require multiple forms of authentication, such as ID badges and security codes, IT infrastructure should also use multi-factor authentication methods to verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access.

- [ ] ***Disaster Recovery Plans:*** Construction sites have disaster recovery plans in place to prepare for emergencies such as natural disasters, and IT infrastructure should also have plans in place to recover from cyber attacks and other security incidents.

- [ ] ***Education and Training:*** Construction site workers receive education and training to follow safety protocols, and IT infrastructure personnel should also receive education and training to follow security protocols and best practices.
