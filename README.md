## Securing Your IT Infrastructure
Lessons from Construction Site Security

## Overview
In this GitHub lab, we will explore the similarities between IT infrastructure and construction sites to gain a better understanding of IT infrastructure security. We will compare the foundational elements, access control, security measures, maintenance and inspections, multi-factor authentication, disaster recovery plans, and education and training in construction site security with IT infrastructure security. By the end of this lab, you will have a better understanding of essential security best practices that can help secure your IT infrastructure.

- [ ] ***Foundation:*** Just like a building's foundation, the IT infrastructure's foundational elements, such as servers and network components, need to be securely designed, installed, and configured.

- [ ] ***Access Control:*** Construction sites limit access to authorized personnel, and IT infrastructure should also have access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data and systems.

- [ ] ***Security Cameras:*** Security cameras are used at construction sites to monitor and identify potential security breaches, and IT infrastructure should also have security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.

- [ ] ***Maintenance and Inspections:*** Regular maintenance and inspections are conducted at construction sites to ensure safety, and IT infrastructure should also undergo regular maintenance and audits to identify and address any vulnerabilities.

- [ ] ***Multi-Factor Authentication:*** Just like construction sites require multiple forms of authentication, such as ID badges and security codes, IT infrastructure should also use multi-factor authentication methods to verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access.

- [ ] ***Disaster Recovery Plans:*** Construction sites have disaster recovery plans in place to prepare for emergencies such as natural disasters, and IT infrastructure should also have plans in place to recover from cyber attacks and other security incidents.

- [ ] ***Education and Training:*** Construction site workers receive education and training to follow safety protocols, and IT infrastructure personnel should also receive education and training to follow security protocols and best practices.


## How can we design homes that incorporate essential IT infrastructure security concepts?

## Activity:

- Divide the class into two groups.
- Ask each group to draw a house that incorporates IT infrastructure security concepts. Each house should have rooms that represent the different security concepts discussed in the lab.
- Each group can present their house to the class and explain how they incorporated the security concepts into their design.
- Encourage the class to ask questions and provide feedback on each group's design.
- After both groups have presented their houses, discuss as a class which design incorporated the most essential security concepts.


### Hints

Here are some possible room ideas for the houses:

***Foundation Room:*** This room represents the foundational elements of IT infrastructure security, such as servers and network components. The group can draw a room that has sturdy walls and is located in a secure part of the house.

***Access Control Room:*** This room represents the access control measures used to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive data and systems. The group can draw a room with a security keypad, biometric scanner, or other access control methods.

***Security Camera Room:*** This room represents the use of security cameras to monitor and identify potential security breaches. The group can draw a room that has multiple security cameras installed in various parts of the house.

***Maintenance and Inspections Room:*** This room represents regular maintenance and audits conducted to identify and address any vulnerabilities. The group can draw a room that has tools and equipment used for regular maintenance and inspections.

***Multi-Factor Authentication Room:*** This room represents the use of multi-factor authentication methods to verify user identity and prevent unauthorized access. The group can draw a room that has multiple authentication methods, such as a security code, a smart card, or a fingerprint scanner.

***Disaster Recovery Plan Room:*** This room represents the disaster recovery plans put in place to prepare for emergencies such as natural disasters or cyber attacks. The group can draw a room that has backup power sources, data backups, and other disaster recovery equipment.

***Education and Training Room:*** This room represents the education and training that IT infrastructure personnel receive to follow security protocols and best practices. The group can draw a room that has books, training materials, and other educational resources.

By incorporating these essential IT infrastructure security concepts into the design of their homes, learners can visualize the importance of these security measures and understand how they can be applied in real-world scenarios.
